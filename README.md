# 👋 Hey there, I’m Enala Kwenda — A Builder of Smart, Curious, and Useful Things 🚀

Welcome to my code cave! 🧠💻  
I'm a **Data + AI-powered Software Developer** who thrives at the intersection of **machine learning, backend engineering, and business intelligence**.  

Whether it's extracting patterns from thousands of messy bug reports, visualizing plant movements with computer vision, or making enterprise data speak in human language — I'm all about making insights **visual, actionable, and unforgettable**.

---

## ⚡️ What I Build
- 🧠 **Intelligent Dashboards**: From Django to Streamlit, I turn raw data into slick, interactive insights.
- 🔍 **Topic Modeling Projects**: I'm a fan of uncovering what users *really* mean — whether it's from GitHub issues, product feedback, or exit interviews.
- 🌿 **Experimental AI**: I'm exploring how ML can interpret nature, like visualizing **nyctinasty** (plant sleep movements) using computer vision + ML.
- 📊 **Business Intelligence Meets NLP**: I combine LDA, transformers, and BI strategy to help teams see what matters most.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- LLM-powered feedback summarizers for product teams  
- AI-based bug report triage system using topic modeling + sentiment  
- Visualization of circadian plant behavior (aka “plant dreams 🌙”)

## ✨ Featured Project
**🕵️‍♂️ BugScope: Extracting the hidden themes in 1,000+ software issues**  
> LDA + Django + Streamlit dashboard that clusters issue descriptions into actionable themes like "auth errors", "performance bottlenecks", and "frontend crashes".

## 📫 Let’s Collaborate!
Got a cool idea around **AI for BI**, **intelligent automation**, or **data storytelling**?  
Let’s build something people will *talk about* (or train an LDA model to tell us why they’re not 😉).  

📍 Open to freelance, collabs, or just a good chat about weird ideas and smarter machines.
